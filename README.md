# express-rest-boilerplate
Boilerplate REST API app (Express, Mongoose, JWT, Babel)

I wanted to work through an example of serving a REST API using Express. It's a work in progress, but I hope to implement the following roadmap and would appreciate any requests/ feedback.

## Roadmap
- [x] Configure Babel ES6.
- [x] Extract Config (separate file).
- [x] Extract DB (separate file).
- [x] User Model.
- [x] Encrypt User Passwords (pre save function).
- [x] Implement JWT Authentication.
- [x] Route Loader (dynamically search for routes in app structure).
- [ ] Serializers (serialize/ deserialize models based on API version).
- [ ] Response Objects (normalize responses).
- [ ] Normalize Error Responses.
- [ ] Resolve Relative Module (localize module references relative to app folder).
